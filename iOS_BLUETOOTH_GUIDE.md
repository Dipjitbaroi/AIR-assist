# iOS Bluetooth Connectivity Guide for AIRAssist

## Overview

This guide provides specific instructions for iOS users (iPhone X and newer) to achieve the best possible Bluetooth connectivity experience with the AIRAssist PWA.

## Understanding iOS Limitations

iOS devices have stricter limitations on Web Bluetooth API functionality compared to Android or desktop browsers:

1. **Limited Browser Support**: Safari has very limited support for Web Bluetooth API. Even Chrome and Edge on iOS use Safari's WebKit engine underneath, inheriting these limitations.

2. **Permission Restrictions**: iOS has a stricter security model for hardware access from web applications.

3. **Connection Stability**: Bluetooth connections through web browsers on iOS can be less stable and may disconnect more frequently.

3. Scroll down and tap "Add to Home Screen"
4. Tap "Add" in the top right corner
